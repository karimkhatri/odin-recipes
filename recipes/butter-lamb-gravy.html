      <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon minced ginger</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the lamb with garam masala and salt. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter
        in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the lamb cubes until browned,
        stirring constantly. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the remaining butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the
        onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned
        translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the turmeric, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
        Stir in the cayenne and tomato paste until well blended, then stir in
        the water. Bring to a simmer and return lamb to the skillet. Simmer over
        low heat for about 20 minutes, or until lamb is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the cream and honey. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with
        cilantro.
